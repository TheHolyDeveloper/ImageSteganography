Image Steganography is a concept where data is hidden inside an image and decrypted at the other end .
In this project , we have developed GUI which will have 2 options ENCODE and DECODE 
ENCODE -> On clicking this button User will be propmted to select an image , embed the  data  and then save it into a new file .
DECODE -> User can select the encoded image and then decode the encrypted message inside an image .
